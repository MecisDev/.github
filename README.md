# MecisDEV

MecisDEV is a "devolopment organisation" that devoloped some ai generated shit or shitty code on python.

MECIS was formerly a Operating systems organisation but then it went down in spring 2022. In 2023 it was united with FatareDEV to FatCisDev and in September 2024 it was renamed back to MECIS but its MecisDEV.
